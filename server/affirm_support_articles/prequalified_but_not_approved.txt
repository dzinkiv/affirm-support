Prequalified but not approved

We can't guarantee you'll get approved for a loan even if you're prequalified. That's because your prequalified amount is an estimate. It may change or go away depending on a few different things, such as borrowing and payment history at Affirm and elsewhere. 

Let's say you prequalify for a new loan, then miss a payment on a current loan. For the short term, you may still see that you're prequalified, but that missed payment may impact your ability to get approved for the new loan. 

If you didn't get approved for a loan this time around, we hope you'll try again in the future.
