Early or late payments

 Are there any fees or penalties for paying early?

Nope. You won’t get dinged with any fees or penalties if you pay early.

And if you pay off your loan before the final payment is due, you’ll save on any interest that hasn’t accrued yet.


What happens if I make a late payment?

We don’t charge late fees. Even so, late or partial payments may hurt your chances to get another loan with Affirm. 


Underpayment

If a payment is less than the amount of the next scheduled installment, then you must pay the difference on or before the corresponding installment due date.
