Create an account

You can create an account when you buy with Affirm at checkout, through the Affirm app, or at affirm.ca. A Canadian mobile phone number is required to create an Affirm account. This helps us verify it's really you who is creating your account and signing in.
  Note:
If you get a new phone number, update it here.
A phone number can be tied to one account only. If you're told that your phone number is already being used, let us know using the 'Still have questions? Contact us' button below.

Set up a passcode, your fingerprint, or face ID
Using a passcode, your fingerprint or facial recognition (on devices that support them) makes signing in to the Affirm app faster and more secure (these sign-in methods aren’t available at affirm.ca).
  If you don’t have a passcode, you’ll be prompted to set one up during the normal sign-in process, or you can always set up a passcode later in your account.
