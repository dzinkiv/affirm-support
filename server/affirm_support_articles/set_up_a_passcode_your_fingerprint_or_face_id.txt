Set up a passcode, your fingerprint, or face ID

  Using a passcode, or your fingerprint or facial recognition (on devices that support them) makes signing in to the Affirm app faster and more secure (these sign-in methods aren’t available at affirm.ca). If you don’t have a passcode, you’ll be prompted to set one up during the normal sign-in process. Or, you can always set up a passcode later in your account. 
  Set up a passcode, fingerprint, or face ID 
  Sign in to the Affirm app.
Tap the profile icon with your initials at the top right of the screen.
Scroll down to Sign-in options.
Tap Set up a passcode, type your passcode, then re-enter it to confirm. (Tip: you can change your passcode if you forget it, but it's a good idea to write it down somewhere secure.)
To use your fingerprint or face ID instead of a passcode, toggle the bar under Sign in options to enable the feature.
  Change or disable your passcode 
Sign in to the Affirm app.
Tap the profile icon with your initials at the top right of the screen.
Scroll down to Sign-in options.
Tap Edit your passcode.
Enter a new passcode.
Re-enter your new passcode.
