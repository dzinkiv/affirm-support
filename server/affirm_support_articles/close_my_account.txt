Close my account

The simple fact of having an Affirm account won't affect your credit score. But if you've paid off your purchases and would like to close your account anyway, just let us know below. We’ll get in touch, then close your account with no impact to your credit.

After closing your account, you won’t be able to sign in or view your loan history. You also won’t be able to prequalify or apply for credit with us.
  If you ever change your mind, you know where to find us. Thanks for using Affirm!
