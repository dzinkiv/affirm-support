PayBright: Update my address

Can I update my shipping address?

For orders that have already been placed:
Unfortunately, as your shipping address is placed directly through the retailer, there is no way on our end to update the address for orders that have already been placed.

In order to update your shipping/delivery address for an existing payment plan, contact the merchant/retailer with whom you placed your order to cancel your order and your associated PayBright Payment Plan. You will then need to replace the order with the correct shipping address.
  For future orders:
If you wish to update your billing address associated with your PayBright account for future orders using PayBright, contact us here. Be sure to provide both your current, and the new address you would like to have your account updated to.

Note: This address should be the billing address associated with your bank, and it should be an exact match with how the Postal Service notates it. 

It may take up to 10 business days for us to update your billing address after you submit the form.
