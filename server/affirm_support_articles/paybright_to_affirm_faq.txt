PayBright to Affirm FAQ

Where can I shop with PayBright? Where can I shop with Affirm?

PayBright and Affirm are now one. PayBright was acquired by Affirm in January 2021 and has since been rebranded. So now, when you’re looking for a pay over time solution at your favorite retailer, simply choose Affirm. Affirm delivers the same transparent, responsible payment option that you’re familiar with. 

Existing PayBright loans will be serviced until they are paid off. You can access your PayBright loan information through the PayBright portal.

Account Management 
I have previously checked out using PayBright. Can I use my PayBright account to checkout with Affirm?
No. When you make your first purchase with Affirm, you’ll create a new, separate account to use to sign in on the Affirm portal. If you have an existing PayBright loan, you can access your PayBright loan and account information through the PayBright portal.
  Is my approval for PayBright still valid with Affirm?
Every time you chose PayBright at checkout, you went through a quick approval process. The same is true for Affirm. Just select Affirm at checkout and enter a few pieces of information (if you're a new user) or your phone number (if you're a returning user) and we'll let you know whether you're approved. For more information on applying for an Affirm loan, check out Apply for a loan.
  What happens to my PayBright loan?  Will it show up as PayBright on my statement?
If you have an existing PayBright loan, you can still access your PayBright loan and account information through the PayBright portal or the PayBright app (available to download for free through the App Store and Google Play Store). However, it will show up on your bank and/or credit card statements as Affirm Canada Holdings.
  Who do I contact if I have questions about my loan?
You can submit a request through the Affirm Help Center.
  Can I consolidate my PayBright payments into my Affirm payments?
No, existing PayBright loans and new Affirm loans will not be consolidated into a single view.
