  Can I change when my payments are due?
Unfortunately, we can't change your payment due dates or offer you more time to pay. 

  Early payments
If you want to pay early, you absolutely can do that. There are no penalties or fees, and for interest bearing loans you'll save on any interest that hasn't accrued yet.
