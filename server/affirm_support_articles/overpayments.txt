Overpayments

Every extra penny goes toward your total loan balance.

  If you pay more than the payment amount due
If you make a single payment that's more than the amount due, the extra amount isn't applied to your next scheduled payment (that payment amount will be the same always). Instead, overpayments are applied to the principal of your loan. This means you may end up with fewer monthly payments, a smaller final payment, or both. You may also save on any interest that hasn't accrued. 

  If you make multiple payments in one installment period
Once payment for the full installment amount due for that month is complete, any subsequent payments made within the installment period will be applied to your payment for the following month.

  If you didn't mean to overpay
No problem. Request a payment refund right here.
