What methods of payment does PayBright accept?
  The methods of payment available to make your automatic PayBright payments are determined by the retailer, and may vary depending on the payment plan selected. 
Our accepted payment methods are: 
Visa Debit/MasterCard Debit
Visa Credit
Mastercard
EFT (Void Cheque or Pre-Authorized Debit form)
  We do not accept: 
E-Transfers
Capital One Credit Card
PayPal
Pre-paid Credit Card
Online Bill Payment

Cheques in the mail 
Please note: We don't accept any Capital One issued credit cards and don't accept Visa credit cards for interest-bearing loans.
  What methods of payment can I use for a Pay in 4 plan?
  For Pay in 4 purchases, you must use a credit card (Visa or MasterCard). Prepaid credit cards are not accepted.
  Can I pay for part of my online purchase using another method of payment?
  For online transactions, your entire purchase (including shipping and taxes) needs to be funded using PayBright. This means that if you weren't approved  for the full cart amount, you won't be able to partially pay for the balance using a different method of payment.
  Why can't I use my Capital One credit card?
  Capital One no longer allows cardholders to use their credit card for certain services, including PayBright. Unfortunately, we are unable to reverse this change.
  Why can’t I use my Capital One card for PayBright transactions? I was able to in the past.
  Capital One has recently made this decision, so you may have been successful in using your Capital One card for your previous purchases with PayBright. At this time, we are not able to process payments toward this card.
  I have an active PayBright Payment Plan that I'm using a Capital One Credit Card to repay. What should I do?
  If you have an active PayBright Payment Plan, please log into your customer portal to update your credit card as soon as possible.
  Why was this change made?
  This change was made by Capital One, and was not a PayBright decision. We will continue to accept payment methods from other issuers for most Payment Plans.
If you have any questions regarding Capital One’s updated policies, please contact their customer team directly.
  How do I update my payment method?
  You can update your credit card or chequing account details by signing in to your PayBright account and navigating to your purchases. Then, select your payment method and click "update". You will have the option to link a credit card or a bank account.
