PayBright: Payment options

Can I combine my payments?

Orders placed on different days will likely have different due dates. Unfortunately we can't combine all your loans into one or change your payment due dates.
  Can I make an extra payment or pay off my balance early?

Absolutely! You are able to make extra payments at any time, with no penalty. Every penny from your extra payment goes directly toward the principal balance. This means that you'll pay less interest overall (if applicable) and can pay off your balance early.

Extra payments are scheduled in addition to your regularly scheduled payments, meaning they do not substitute your upcoming scheduled payment, and won't lower the amount of your monthly payments. However, they can reduce the term of your payment plan, the amount of your final payment, or both.

To schedule extra payments or a full balance payoff, please log into your PayBright Portal, select the payment plan you want to pay off, and select “Make A Payment.”  You will then have the option to either make an extra payment or repay your balance in full.

Please keep in mind, you cannot make an extra payment until your first scheduled payment has gone through.
