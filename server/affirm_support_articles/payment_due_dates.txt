  When are my payments due?
To see when your payments are due, sign in to your Affirm account and navigate to your loan details. 

You can expect your first monthly payment to be due about one month after we process your loan. Each following payment will be due a month later on the same day of the month. 

  Example
Let's say you take out a loan and agree to pay it back over three months. If your loan is finalized on January 1, your first payment is due on February 1. Your second payment is due on March 1. And your third payment is due on April 1. 

  Multiple loans
If you have multiple loans through Affirm, they probably have different due dates. We'll help you remember when to make payments with email and SMS reminders.
