Scammers aim to steal your money or information for their personal gain – learn how you can protect yourself and your personal information: 
Be wary of any unsolicited emails, phone calls, or text messages that ask for your personal or banking information. If you receive a suspicious email, phone call, or text message from someone claiming to be Affirm, please report it.
Never share your PIN or passcodes with anyone. Affirm will never ask you for your PIN, One Time Passcode, or password.
Check your Affirm account regularly to ensure that all transactions are legitimate. Report any unauthorized transactions to Affirm immediately.
Use complex, unique passwords for your accounts that are difficult to guess. Avoid using common passwords or easy-to-find information like your birthdate or pet's name.
