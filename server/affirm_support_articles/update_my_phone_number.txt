Update my phone number

Your phone number is how Affirm ties you to your account. It’s required for signing in to your account, so you have to update it if it changes.
  To update your phone number, let us know using the 'Still have questions? Contact us' button below. You can also call us at 888-484-4282 between the hours of 8:00 am and 11:00 pm Eastern Time seven days a week.

Note:
This is the only way to update your phone number with us. Creating a new account won’t work and may even delay a future request to update your number.
A phone number can be tied to one account only. If you're told that your phone number is already being used, let us know using the 'Still have questions? Contact us' button below.
