About prequalifying

When you prequalify, you get an estimate of how much you can spend with Affirm. You donâ€™t have to use the full amount, and you're not on the hook to pay the amount back until you actually make a purchase. 

Prequalified amount vs. credit limit

A prequalified amount is an estimate of what a lender may qualify you to borrow in the future. This is different from a credit limit. A credit limit is the maximum amount of credit a lender has already decided you can borrow. 

Prequalifying just takes a minute and won't affect your credit score. Look for the option while you're shopping online.
