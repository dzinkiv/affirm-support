Close my account with Affirm

If you’ve made all your payments and you want to close your account with Affirm, let us know by clicking or tapping "Still have questions, contact us" below. Closing your account means that you won’t be able to sign in to Shop Pay to view your installments history, and you won’t be able to pay with Shop Pay Installments.
  If you're paying for an order using Shop Pay installments, then you can opt out of Shop Pay once your payments are complete.
