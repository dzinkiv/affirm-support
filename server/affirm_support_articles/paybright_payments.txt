PayBright payments

Automatic payment withdrawals 
Your payments will be set up as convenient pre-authorized debits from your chequing account. In some cases, you can also set up automatic payments from your Visa or Mastercard debit or credit card.
This means you don’t have to worry about setting reminders and being charged sneaky late fees!
  Why hasn't my payment been debited yet?
Your payments will always be debited as per your payment schedule. However, they can take up to 3 business days to process and appear on your bank or credit card statement, depending on your bank. If your payment hasn't been debited in over 72 business hours, please contact us so we can look into it to ensure your account remains in good standing.
  What if I can't make my payment on time?
Sometimes, things come up. We understand. If you're running behind this month, please send us a message ASAP. While we can't promise to accommodate all requests, we'll try our best to work with you to keep your account in good standing.
  Will I be charged any fees for missing a payment?
We don't charge any late fees, however, missing a payment will prevent you from being able to make future purchases using PayBright.

Why did my pre-authorized payment fail?
If we've debited a payment and it returns, please double check the payment details provided. Non-sufficient funds (NSF), incorrect banking details, or an expired credit card are the most common reasons for a failed payment attempt.
  If I missed a payment, when will it be re-debited?
  For Equal Monthly Payment Plans:
If your payment method is a credit or debit card, We'll automatically re-schedule your missed payment for the following Friday, until the payment clears. If your payment method is a chequing account, your missed payment will be re-scheduled for every other Friday, until the payment clears.

For Pay in 4 Plans:
If you miss a Pay in 4 payment, our system will automatically re-schedule it to be re-attempted on your configured Debit/Credit card, at a later date. To find out when your missed payment will be re-debited, log in to your PayBright account to view your updated payment schedule.
Please be sure to update your payment method if you need to before the next scheduled attempt! 

Can I combine my payments?
Orders placed on different days will likely have different due dates. Unfortunately we can't combine all your loans into one or change your payment due dates.


Can I make an extra payment or pay off my balance early?
Absolutely! You are able to make extra payments at any time, with no penalty. Every penny from your extra payment goes directly toward the principal balance. This means that you'll pay less interest overall (if applicable) and can pay off your balance early.
  Extra payments are scheduled in addition to your regularly scheduled payments, meaning they do not substitute your upcoming scheduled payment, and won't lower the amount of your monthly payments. However, they can reduce the term of your payment plan, the amount of your final payment, or both.
  To schedule extra payments or a full balance payoff, please log into your PayBright Portal, select the payment plan you want to pay off, and select “Make A Payment.”  You will then have the option to either make an extra payment or repay your balance in full.
  Please keep in mind, you cannot make an extra payment until your first scheduled payment has gone through.
