Find my loan ID

Your loan ID is the unique identifier for your loan. We’ll ask you for it if you need to get in touch about a specific loan.
  You can find your loan ID near the end of all payment reminder emails.
  It’s also on your Affirm account. Sign in, navigate to your loan, and click Details to find it.
