Make a down payment

You may not always qualify for the full amount of your purchase. When this happens, we'll ask you to make a down payment with your credit or debit card. We'll process this payment right after you confirm your loan. 

After that, your first monthly payment is due at the usual time - about a month after your loan is finalized. You can review your payment schedule in your account once the loan is confirmed.
  Volunteer for a down payment
You can't choose to make a down payment if it's not offered to you, but you can begin making payments of any amount as soon as your loan is confirmed. 
  Change a down payment 
You can't change the amount of your down payment. The good news is not all loans come with down payments, so you can always try again for something else.

Note: If your order wasn't processed, your down payment usually won’t be processed either. However, you might see a pending hold for the down payment in your account (the one you used to make the down payment). This doesn’t mean that the down payment went through, and you’ll usually see the hold drop from your account within 7–10 business days.
