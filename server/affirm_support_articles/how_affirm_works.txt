How Affirm works

With Affirm, you can buy now and pay over time at your favourite stores. We’re here to help you pay for the things you love. Just select Affirm at checkout and choose the flexible payment schedule that works for you. You'll never pay more than what you agree to up front.

Interest: If your payment plan includes interest, you'll see the total amount of interest owed at checkout, and we'll never charge more than that amount. This way, you always know what you're getting into. The range for our annual percentage rate (APR) is 0-32% (subject to provincial limitations).
 
No fees: We don’t charge any fees. That means no late fees, no prepayment fees, no annual fees, and no fees to open or close your account.
