  What should I do if I’ve been impacted by the coronavirus?
Many of our customers are facing unprecedented challenges right now, and we’re sorry to hear you’ve been impacted. Please know that we care about you and your financial well-being, and we’re on your side—this is why we built Affirm. You can continue to count on us for transparency and no late fees.

  What if I need to cancel my purchase?
To cancel a purchase, please reach out directly to the store where you made your purchase. Since many stores are experiencing a high volume of customer service requests, we encourage you to check their website for any coronavirus-specific policies that amend their normal cancellation or refund options.
  After your cancellation or refund has been processed by the store, it will be reflected on your loan balance.

  What should I do if I’m going to miss a payment?
If you’re experiencing unexpected hardship due to the coronavirus, and you won’t be able to make an upcoming payment, please let us know here.
