Payment issues

Overpayments

If you overpaid your total purchase balance, we’ll automatically refund the payment method you have on file.
  If you only overpaid a single monthly bill, that extra amount will go toward your total purchase balance. Alternatively, you can request a payment refund below.
 
Accidental payments
Please contact us below to request a refund for any online payment you didn’t mean to make. Payment reversal requests must be made no more than 3 calendar days after you submit the payment.
  We’ll reverse the full amount of the payment after it finishes processing. You should see the funds reflected in your bank account in 3-10 business days, depending on your financial institution.
  Keep in mind that we are not always able to reverse a payment due to limitations with payment processors and banking institutions. If we are unable to reverse your payment, we will let you know.
  Very important side note: We can only give you a full refund, not a partial one. If you’re close to your payment due date, a refund may put you at risk for a late payment.
