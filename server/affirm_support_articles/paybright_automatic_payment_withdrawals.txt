PayBright: Automatic payment withdrawals

Your payments will be set up as convenient pre-authorized debits from your chequing account. In some cases, you can also set up automatic payments from your Visa or Mastercard debit or credit card.

This means you donâ€™t have to worry about setting reminders and being charged sneaky late fees!
  Why hasn't my payment been debited yet?

Your payments will always be debited as per your payment schedule. However, they can take up to 3 business days to process and appear on your bank or credit card statement, depending on your bank. If your payment hasn't been debited in over 72 business hours, please contact us so we can look into it to ensure your account remains in good standing.
