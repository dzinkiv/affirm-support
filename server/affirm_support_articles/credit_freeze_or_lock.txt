Credit freeze or lock

If there's a freeze or lock on your credit report when you apply for Shop Pay installments, then you'll have to remove it before we can process your application. You can do this online, by phone or by mail.

When you lift your freeze or lock online or by phone, you should wait an hour before you contact Affirm to continue your application.

When you lift your freeze or lock by mail, it can take up to 30 days for the lift to take effect. You can contact Affirm after the freeze or lock is lifted.
  Note: At this time, only Quebec residents are eligible for the TransUnion credit freeze.
Affirm works with TransUnion. You need to lift your freeze or lock at TransUnion where you have one in place.
