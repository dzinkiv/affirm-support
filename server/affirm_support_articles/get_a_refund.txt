Get a refund

Contact the store where you bought your item to request a refund. They can let you know if a return is possible and the refund amount, according to their own return policy.

Once we receive confirmation from the store, the refund will show up on your loan balance within 3–10 business days. You can see your loan balance in your Affirm account.

Note: While you’re waiting for your refund, continue to make any payments that are due.
  Refund is less than balance

If the store issues a partial refund that is less than your purchase balance, the refund amount will be deducted from your remaining balance. Depending on your remaining payment schedule, you might see fewer payments due or a lower final payment. Sign in to your Affirm account to view your updated payment schedule.
  Refund is more than balance

If the store issues a partial refund that is more than your purchase balance, the remaining balance will be canceled and you will get back the difference, minus any interest you have paid. Affirm will credit your original payment method within 3–10 business days. If you don’t have a payment method on file, you’ll get a check in the mail within 14 business days.

Refund for paid interest

Paid interest is not refundable. When you make payments, the funds are first applied to the accrued unpaid interest and then the principal. Since the interest is the only cost of borrowing with Affirm, it is not refundable.
