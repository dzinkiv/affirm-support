My identity needs to be verified

When you need to update your account information, the process may require us to verify who you are with photos of your valid ID.

In this case, we email you a link to an identity verification form that you need to complete and return to us within three calendar days. If you submit the form after three calendar days of receiving this email, your request will be denied. 

Make sure you follow our third-party partner’s guidelines for photos: 
They must be live and not edited, and they can’t be pictures of scans.
They must be of either a passport, identity card, or driver’s license.
They must be clear with all identifying information visible.

If the photos are blurry or we’re unable to see the necessary information, we may deny your request to update your account information. To get a new link, use the 'Still have questions? Contact us' button below.

After you submit your identity verification form, we’ll get back to you in a few days.
  Note: The process above applies only to identity verification for updating account information. It doesn’t apply to identity verification during checkout with Affirm.
