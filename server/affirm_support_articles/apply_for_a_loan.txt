Apply for a loan

You can apply for a loan by following the steps below:
Fill your cart, then select Affirm at checkout.
Enter your mobile number, then select Continue.
If it's your first time applying, create an account. If you already have an account, this step is skipped. 
Enter the 4-digit verification code we just texted to your phone.
See your loan decision. 
  No loan limit

There is no limit to how many loans you can have at one time.  But if you've recently opened credit accounts, we'll consider that when reviewing your application. We also consider things like your payment history, how much credit you've used, and how long you've had credit.
