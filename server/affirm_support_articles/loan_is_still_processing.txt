Loan is still processing

Your loan is confirmed and good to go, even if it's still processing. After you pay with Affirm, the store finalizes your order and prepares it for shipment. During this time, your loan is in a processing status. 

Your loan is finalized around the same time that the store ships your order. You'll get email and text updates from us after that happens, usually within 2 business days. You'll also see the exact due dates for your monthly payments. 
  You can check the status of your loan by signing in to your Affirm account.
